        Hi! My name is Madeleine and I am a full stack software developer! Prior
        to making the switch from Marketing to Tech- I worked for well known
        startups doing product building and influencer marketing. This helped me
        to realize that what I really wanted to do was the building of products!
        With my background in design and marketing combined with a degree in
        psychology - I can communicate my ideas clearly, build what I need to
        build and make it look good! I see myself as an enthusiastic,
        hardworking, life long learner with a positive attitude and a desire to
        show up and get the job done every day.
